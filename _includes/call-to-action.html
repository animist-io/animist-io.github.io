                <p class="text-faded">Animist's goal is to enable contracts whose fullfillment is strongly tied to someone presence at a specific place in time. Such contracts can have arbitrary complexity - they might require repeated appearances, define locations by type, have varied time conditions or mandate certain sensor data from a mobile device. 
                <br><br>
                Users who satisfy a contract win anonymous ownership of a virtual currency with some defined exchange value. 
                <br><br> 
                Components under development include mobile and IoT applications that can execute location specific contract clauses without requiring a user's intentional engagement, and online tools to allow people to manage these contracts and their exchange values on the Ethereum blockchain. </p>
