                  Two friends in New York who love to run decide to wager $20 on a foot race from the small bakery at 248 Broome Street in LES to the natural foods bodega across the Williamsburg Bridge at 282 Broadway. There's an app for that, called Human Race. Both locations host Animist enabled IOT nodes the app can tap into to detect their presence and execute conditional payment contracts on the Ethereum chain.

            <div class="col-lg-11 col-sm-11 col-xs-11">
               <p>
                  They meet at the bakery, eat a snack and register the bet through their phones. The app fires a starting shot.  Whoever reaches the bodega first is detected by its Animist endpoint and gets the $20 virtual wager automatically transferred to their virtual account.

                  Human Race also permits side bets on this race in jurisdictions where casual betting is legal. It sets aside a portion of that betting pool for a jackpot awarded to the race winner. Maybe the winner gets more than $20! Maybe not. Depends on their social media connections to people in England.
